        <h3>"Questions" - A Visual Interpretation of Chanel</h3>
        <img src="Questions.jpg" alt="Questions" style="width:300px; height:auto;" />
        <p>
          This piece is a visual interpretation of my childhood friend, Chanel—someone who isn't always easy to read but carries an immense depth beneath the surface. At first glance, the composition is fragmented, abstract, and layered with obscurity, much like how Chanel presents herself to the world. There's a certain mystery in her presence, a guarded nature that doesn't immediately reveal its meaning.
          The dark silhouette, almost hidden within the composition, mirrors the way Chanel exists in a space—observant, thoughtful, and enigmatic. She doesn't give everything away at once, but once you take the time to understand her, you begin to see the full picture. The textured upper half, blended with deep earthy browns and muted shadows, represents the complexity of her personality—layers upon layers of experiences, emotions, and guarded thoughts.
          Moving downward, the abstract distortion transitions into a lighter, fragmented space, symbolizing the clarity that comes when you begin to truly understand her. This piece is called "Questions" because, at first, it is a puzzle—a series of unspoken thoughts and quiet mysteries.
