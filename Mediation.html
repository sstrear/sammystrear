        <h3>"Mediation" – A Reflection on Perspective</h3>
        <img src="Mediation.jpg" alt="Mediation" style="width:300px; height:auto;" />
        <p>
          "Mediation" is an exploration of the tension between perception and understanding, a visual dialogue between conflicting identities, internalized emotions, and external projections. The composition is fractured yet symmetrical, mirroring the nature of mediation itself—a process of balance, negotiation, and self-exploration.
          At its core, two mirrored faces stare forward, their expressions heavy, almost frozen in contemplation. They are caught in a liminal space, neither fully connected nor completely apart, representing the struggle of seeing oneself clearly amid external forces and internal conflicts. The dark, high-contrast aesthetic adds weight to this concept, stripping away unnecessary detail and focusing the viewer on raw emotion.
          The hand-drawn elements—a boxed eye, a circled mouth—serve as focal points, marking areas of distortion and emphasis. They act as symbols of perception: the eye boxed in, as if confined to a limited viewpoint, and the mouth circled, suggesting speech that is either censored, misunderstood, or waiting to be released. Between the two faces, a spray of fragmented light connects them, symbolizing a moment of exchange, an attempt to bridge perspectives.
          The black void above is intentional—it represents the unknown, the unsaid, the subconscious weight that looms over mediation. Silence can be just as powerful as words, and in this piece, the vast emptiness creates an eerie, meditative pause, forcing the viewer to engage with the figures on a deeper level.
          At its core, Mediation is about understanding—about the space between two perspectives, the process of deconstructing and rebuilding meaning.
